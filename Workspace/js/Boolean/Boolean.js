// Boolean
// In computer science, a Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false. 
// For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections 
// of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).
// 
// Below is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.

/* JavaScript if statement */
if (boolean conditional) {
    // code to execute if the conditional is true
}

if (boolean conditional) {
    console.log("boolean conditional resolved to true");
} else {
    console.log("boolean conditional resolved to false");
}

/* JavaScript for loop */
for (control variable; boolean conditional; counter) {
    // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true
}

for (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    console.log("I print only when the boolean conditional is true");
}
