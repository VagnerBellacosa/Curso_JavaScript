// Array
// An array is an ordered collection of data (either primitive or object depending upon the language).
// Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable
// that can store only one value. 
// 
// Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index,
//  that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index zero and
// can be manipulated with various methods. 
// 
// What an array in JavaScript looks like:

let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let catNamesArray = ["Jacqueline", "Sophia", "Autumn"];
//Arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of data, as shown above.
