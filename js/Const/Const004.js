// Block scoping
// It's important to note the nature of block scoping.

if (MY_FAV === 7) {
  // this is fine and creates a block scoped MY_FAV variable
  // (works equally well with let to declare a block scoped non const variable)
  let MY_FAV = 20;

  // MY_FAV is now 20
  console.log('my favorite number is ' + MY_FAV);

  // this gets hoisted into the global context and throws an error
  var MY_FAV = 20;
}

// MY_FAV is still 7
console.log('my favorite number is ' + MY_FAV);
